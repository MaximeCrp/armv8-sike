# armv8-sike
Highly-optimized ARMv8 implementation of Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE).

This repository contains the efficient implementation of SIKE protocol on ARMv8 high-perforamnce processors. 
The finite field arithmetic implementation is developed by the state-of-the-art implementation techniques, taking advantage of ARMv8 64-bit general purpose registers combined with ASIMD vectorization.
